    <h1>Kickstarting my web-dev journey</h1>

            Recently I kickstarted my exciting web development journey. Below is a blog about the experiences I had.
            This blog might help anyone looking for entering into web development journey.
        </p>

        <p class="hero">
            The drive for finally starting web development came from my friend Kushank who recently got into a good
            company with a handsome salary. I got to know about neoG camp from him. I got to know how students with
            humble backgrounds, low tier colleges and even non CS-people are getting into webdev following this camp.
            Further I also saw students projects on Github and linkedIn seeing which really made me curious about how
            these technologies worried? So finally I decided that this is the best time to dip my feets into the world
            of web development.

            We 4-5 friends got to know about neoG and the level0 and level1 challenge. Level0 is open for any student
            interested in programming, be it CS or non CS student. Students are needed to complete 15 small tasks
            followed by a short interview cracking which will lead to admission in neoG.

            Now coming to my experience with web development. Previously I had done some Android development so web
            development did not feel completely alien to me. The HTML files reminded me of the XML layouts we create in
            android to create the UI. The driving logic written in JS felt like writing logic in Kotlin for an android
            app. These beginner marks were easy to make with the help of Tanay sir’s youtube playlist.

        </p>

        <p class="hero">
            I learned how HTML is the basic skeleton of a website and CSS is the decoration over it. Understood really
            closely about how a website works with Javascript. Seen how the websites are hosted on a server from which
            it is served to end users to be accessed anytime anywhere. The CSS were confusing at the beginning, aligning
            to center was something which took time for me. But eventually I got the trick by doing some experiments and
            following the DOM from the Chrome dev tools. VS Code feels so lightweight and snappy but I was not satisfied
            with it’s auto-complete. This is maybe because JS is a dynamically typed language?

        </p>
        <p class="hero">
            Overall I am very happy by starting the web dev. Now I feel really confident after having a portfolio, after
            having 5-6 apps on my github. I am very positive about getting selected into neoG and getting into a dream
            company soon. Special thanks to Tanay sir at Microsoft for giving equal opportunity to everybody.
