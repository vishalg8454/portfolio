        <h1>My notes</h1>
        <h2 style="padding-left:20px;">22/09/2021</h2>
        <p>
            While learning a new thing, especially from youtube/online resources very often we are in the mood to just
            binge watch the whole playlist. It is quite tempting to not take any notes and just hope that we will recall
            things when we need them. Same is the case with me, so I have this time decided to note down some points
            while learning the web development basics. They can be completely random, not following any order. These are
            listed below.
        </p>

                    “+” can be used to convert a string to a number.
                </p>
                typeof(“2”) //string
                typeof(+”2”) //number
            </li>

                JavaScript is a language whereas ECMAscript is the specification. ECMA is an international organization
                that standardizes information and communication standards. ECMA262 covers JavaScript standardization.

                Node is a runtime for running JavaScript programs out of the browser. This way Javascript programs can
                be used in places apart from websites(for ex- server side programming). Node JS uses the same engine as
                used by Google Chrome i.e V8.

            <li>
                fetch() API is provided by the host environment. It is not something shipped with JavaScript. To use the
                fetch() API in standalone JS files we can use some libraries such as ‘node-fetch’ or 'axios'.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Npm is a system for distributing JavaScript packages. The libraries are written by developers and then
                sent out to npm servers to be distributed. Individual users can download the required dependency using
                the <strong>npm install</strong> command.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Functions in JS are in global scope by default. A function can be defined at the bottom-most of a
                program but still can be used at the top.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>console.table()</strong> can be used to print the contents of a object in nice table manner.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ol>
        <p>
            I will keep adding more points to this list as my learning grows...
